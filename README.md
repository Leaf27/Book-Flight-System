# Book-Flight-System

This is the project for CS509.<br>
Using Java to design a flight book system by which users can search, sort and reserve flights.<br>
GUI is used to create the user interface of the system.<br>
Breadth-first search is used to search all possibilities. BFS is convenient especially when 	<br>
users want to specify number of stops which is as same as the number of search levels.<br>
HashMap is used to store data which is parsed from XML file.<br>
System fires HTML post and get request to the server when users want to reserve flights. <br>
